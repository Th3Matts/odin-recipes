👋 **Hey there!**

Welcome to **Odin Recipes – Dishes That Can Make Any God Fall at His Feet** 🛡️🗡️

This is my **first project** with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I’ll be creating a simple recipe website. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I’ll be building a basic webpage that lists three different recipes. Each recipe will link to its own dedicated page.

For this initial version, I’ll only be using **HTML** to structure the website and its content and **CSS** to style it.

## Features

- A homepage with a list of three recipes
- Each recipe links to a separate page with details about that dish
- Simple and clean HTML structure

## Technologies Used

- **HTML + CSS**
