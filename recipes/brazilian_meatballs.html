    <h3> Description </h3>
      <p>
        These Italian meatballs are very easy to make, and since we skip the
        messy step of pan-frying the meatballs, it becomes downright simple!
        Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. Once the meatballs
        are baked, add them to your favorite prepared tomato sauce and simmer
        for 1 to 2 hours.

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>½ cup milk or beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 ½ inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve with your favorite tomato sauce. Enjoy!</li>
